------------ RInsightF461 Nuget Readme  ------------
----------------------------------------------------

This library is equivalent to the [RInsight](https://github.com/lloyddewit/RInsight) library, 
but it is targetted at the .NET Framework 4.6.1 (rather than (.NET 7.0).
This library parses script written in the R programming language and creates a .NET recursive 
object model of the R statements and their components. The object model can be easily analyzed and 
updated within the .NET environment. If needed, the library can also generate new R script from an 
updated model. This library has potential applications within R editors, R formatters, R GUI 
builders and R static analysis tools. For an example of this library in use, please see 
https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat.
